After reaching part 8 of the tutorial found here (http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/8), I have hit a wall that I cannot break through due to my novice experience.  I have decided that I have gotten everything I can out of this exercise and am throwing in the towel for now.

There is no shame in admitting defeat.  This was a huge undertaking and taught me more than I could have anticipated.  I intend to try again in a couple months once I have more experience and confidence.
